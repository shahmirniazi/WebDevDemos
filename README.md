#Simon Game
This is a intermediate javascript-oriented project based on the popular "Simon Game". The game involves four buttons of different colors.
The buttons play a sound when clicked. 
Once the game is started, a button is played randomly by the "computer". The player has to mimic the pattern the computer plays to win. 
There are 20 rounds in the game. 
"strict mode" only allows for one mistake. 

I used Javascript, CSS and HTML for the development.
